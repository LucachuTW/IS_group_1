# Project Summary

This project involves creating an advanced domestic environment featuring an "owner" and several multifunctional robots designed to assist with daily tasks, with a special emphasis on health. The robots will be responsible for managing the owner's necessary medications as well as handling their purchase and delivery. Additionally, there will be continuous updates on the owner's vital signs to determine if further medical intervention is needed. All these agents and their actions will be recorded in a virtual space that mirrors the structure of the house and is continuously updated. The environment will terminate if the owner passes away.
