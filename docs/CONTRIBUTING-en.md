# Project Collaboration Guidelines

This repository will serve as a hub for consolidating contributions from different pairs, enabling us to coordinate and divide tasks efficiently.
Our primary focus will revolve around addressing and completing the outlined issues. Given the diverse teams and various parts of the software within the project, multiple teams may collaborate on certain issues based on their complexity.

As the project progresses to a more advanced stage, we won't commit directly to the main branch. Instead, we'll create individual branches for our work and utilize pull requests. These pull requests will be reviewed and accepted by another member of the group.

All software should have comments indicating its creation date, creator, editor, and comprehensive documentation.
