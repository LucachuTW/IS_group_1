        Problems:
            - No way to check if the number is not prime
            if the symbol is hidden there. This is because
            prime calculations are in the model and the users
            have no direct access to the model.
            - This code is very similar to getPositionOf in houseModel.py,
            the same function could be used. This could be made if the View is added
            some functions that transfer the results of methods from the Model. This
            would also solve the not prime problem.
            - No solutions if the coordinates are not found
            Maybe add default positions that are added by the controller?
            Problem -> Controller should not have this power?
